      I appreciate my good friend Bill Buford, the manager of
      the Len Foote Hike Inn, picking me up and driving me
      to the Inn as I arrived late in the evening.

      The picturesque scenery around the Inn made for a
       wonderful photography opportunity. I enjoyed catching
       up with Bill around the campfire, hearing his
      fascinating stories of leaving the corporate lifestyle
      to travel and photograph the world!
