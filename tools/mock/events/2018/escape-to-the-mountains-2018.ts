      On the weekend of October 6, 2018 my longtime friend Donna
      Jeffries and I escaped to the mountains. Visiting Helen,
      Blue Ridge and Sautee there were so many amazing moments
      but there are three that stand out.
      `,
    `
      One highlight of the trip was visiting Tommy Conner, a
      great friend and musician which I hadn't seen in over a
      year. Walking into the Cowboys and Angels Bar he even
      stopped his set to greet me, that was a great feeling! I
      even had the opportunity to meet his wife.
      `,
    `
      Another amazing moment was on the hay ride at Smithgall
      Woods State Park. Since I was child, a dream has been to
      be a National Geographic photographer. To my surprise the
      hay ride driver had seen my photography gear and stopped
      when he had reached a particularly scenic location. He
      then announced to the passengers that he had to stop for a
      National Geographic photographer to take pictures. When
      everyone on the hayride turned to look at me, I realized
      he meant me! Phenomenal!
      `,
    `
      My last favorite experience was with the manager of the
      Castle Inn in Helen, Debbie Watson. Having visited the
      hotel several times I had become friends with Debbie and
      she invited me to spend time at her home. Meeting her
      husband, playing music, with great laughter and
      storytelling made me feel I was among family."
      `,
    `
      Needless to say, I can't wait for my next mountain escape adventure!
