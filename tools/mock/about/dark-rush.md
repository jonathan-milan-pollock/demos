At the age of 4 my Dad let me use his Polaroid camera and I've been taking photographs ever since. In 1999, I moved from my small southern hometown of Alexander City, Alabama to Birmingham to work as a flight attendant for US Airways. Wherever we landed, I would venture out with my camera. I moved to Atlanta in 2003 and I began working with several professional photographers.

In 2016, I started my own company Dark Rush Photography to provide high quality photographs for clients that capture the emotion of the moment. People have said that my ability to capture details and reactions in images is my gift. Perhaps this is because I feel it is important when you are looking at a photograph that you can feel like you are there; and the longer you look the more you will see.
