    I've known Dark for the past 15 years. She has photographed my life
    event's over the years with her Southern charm and professionalism. She
    has a way of blending the authenticity and "realness" of people with
    magical auras. She's a talented, patient, creative professional. With her
    flexibility & her amazing eye for detail/framing, I highly recommend her
    to everyone for excellence in photography.
