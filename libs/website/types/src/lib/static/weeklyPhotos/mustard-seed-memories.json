    "My grandmother and I used to always call each other big mustard seed and little mustard seed. My grandmother used to have a silver christmas tree that rotated and changed colors. I thought her christmas tree was the most, now that I know the word, nostalgic christmas tree. To me it was a disco tree, something I had never seen before! When I was older I found one just like hers which parents now put up every year, where this beautiful green bulb hangs."
