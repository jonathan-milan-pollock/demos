    "Oh this photograph! This photograph is the same gypsy where I was with my great friend Shante. I love this photograph! In every inch that I see it could tell so many different stories. It's your story, not my story, it's your story. Whatever you perceive it to be. One of my all time favorite photos. The pocket watch is from a time in the 60's where gentlemen wore them. There is a bell, so many dimensions really, and tarot cards that speak to people in different ways. There are tarot cards in the back that could tell a different story. This reminds me of what a Stevie Nicks photograph would be."
