    "I love this photo because I grew up right next to a train track. Although the sound of the train might annoy some people, to me there was such a magical feeling for me and my family. When we would hear the train outside rounding the corner and coming down the track, my mom and I don't even say a word, we just look at each other and ran to the door to watch the train go by, and the rest of the family follows."
