    "This reminds me of the movie Almost Famous when the boy says, \"I have to go home\" and the response is \"You Already are Home\" as Tiny Dancer plays in the background.  My parents and I were in the Smoky Mountains when we met the couple that owned this beetle.  A railroad is also in the background.  I think this is the coolest picture ever and one of my all-time favorites I've taken."
