As an essential skill for website development, we'll pragmatically cover the concepts of SASS following the book Pragmatic Guide to Sass 3 <https://pragprog.com/titles/pg_sass3/pragmatic-guide-to-sass-3/>.

This class will be at the 100-200 level teaching from the ground up on the fundamentals of SASS. The goal is to be proficient in the concepts of speaking about and implementing SASS. We will use VS Code for this course.

## About Instructor

Jonathan Milan Pollock, MS

I’m one of the lucky ones, to have an over 20-year career that’s also a passion. How many can say they honestly love their day jobs? With both the excitement and reward of building new and refining older enterprise solutions, it’s like playing with Legos for adults! This enjoyment has led me to obtaining my master’s at the University of Michigan in Computer Information Science, avid reading and learning new skills, and the overall opportunity to help and teach others. I’m fortunate to architect, lead, and develop website and Azure cloud projects, having my kind of fun! Outside of work I own a small photography business where I am a certified drone pilot and dabble in new technologies including Extended Reality (XR).
