## About Instructor

Jonathan Milan Pollock, MS

I’m one of the lucky ones, to have an over 20-year career that’s also a passion. How many can say they honestly love their day jobs? With both the excitement and reward of building new and refining older enterprise solutions, it’s like playing with Legos for adults! This enjoyment has led me to obtaining my master’s at the University of Michigan in Computer Information Science with a specialization in Data Engineering, avid reading and learning new skills, and the overall opportunity to help and teach others. I’m fortunate to architect, lead, develop and deploy cloud projects, having my kind of fun!
