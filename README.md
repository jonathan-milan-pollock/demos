# CSS in Depth

## CSS in Depth

### Introduction

While many libraries including Bootstrap, Material, and Tailwind simplify the use of CSS, what happens under the hood? As knowledge of CSS is an essential skill for website development, we'll take a closer look following a wonderful book Manning CSS in Depth <https://www.manning.com/books/css-in-depth>. Each class we'll cover a chapter outlining best practices and how to use the material covered in the book.

This course will be at the 100-200 level teaching from the ground up on the fundamentals of CSS. The goal is to be proficient in the language of speaking about and implementing CSS. We will use VS Code for this course.
