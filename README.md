## About Instructor

Jonathan Milan Pollock, MS

I’m one of the lucky ones, to have an over 20-year career that’s also a passion. With both the excitement and reward of building new and refining older enterprise solutions, it’s like playing with Legos for adults! This enjoyment has led to avid reading, learning new skills, and the overall opportunity to help and teach others. I’m fortunate to architect, lead, develop and deploy cloud-based projects, having my kind of fun!
